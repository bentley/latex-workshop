Abstract = {{We report the fabrication of devices in which one single-walled carbon
   nanotube spans a barrier between two fluid reservoirs, enabling direct
   electrical measurement of ion transport through the tube. A fraction of
   the tubes pass anomalously high ionic currents. Electrophoretic
   transport of small single-stranded DNA oligomers through these tubes is
   marked by large transient increases in ion current and was confirmed by
   polymerase chain reaction analysis. Each current pulse contains about
   10(7) charges, an enormous amplification of the translocated charge.
   Carbon nanotubes simplify the construction of nanopores, permit new
   types of electrical measurements, and may open avenues for control of
   DNA translocation.}},

   than the pore are translocated at a constant speed, the velocity of

   effective diffusion coefficient and the energy penalty for extending a

abstract  ="Glucose and ATP biosensors have important applications in diagnostics and research. Biosensors based on conventional materials suffer from low sensitivity and low spatial resolution. Our previous work has shown that combining single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with Pt nanoparticles can significantly enhance the performance of electrochemical biosensors. The immobilization of SWCNTs on biosensors remains challenging due to the aqueous insolubility originating from van der Waals forces. In this study{,} we used single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to modify SWCNTs to increase solubility in water. This allowed us to explore new schemes of combining ssDNA-SWCNT and Pt black in aqueous media systems. The result is a nanocomposite with enhanced biosensor performance. The surface morphology{,} electroactive surface area{,} and electrocatalytic performance of different fabrication protocols were studied and compared. The ssDNA-SWCNT/Pt black nanocomposite constructed by a layered scheme proved most effective in terms of biosensor activity. The key feature of this protocol is the exploitation of ssDNA-SWCNTs as molecular templates for Pt black electrodeposition. The glucose and ATP microbiosensors fabricated on this platform exhibited high sensitivity (817.3 nA/mM and 45.6 nA/mM{,} respectively){,} wide linear range (up to 7 mM and 510 [small mu ]M){,} low limit of detection (1 [small mu ]M and 2 [small mu ]M) and desirable selectivity. This work is significant to biosensor development because this is the first demonstration of ssDNA-SWCNT/Pt black nanocomposite as a platform for constructing both single-enzyme and multi-enzyme biosensors for physiological applications."}

abstract ={Wrapping of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was found to be sequence-dependent. A systematic search of the ssDNA library selected a sequence d(GT)n, n = 10 to 45 that self-assembles into a helical structure around individual nanotubes in such a way that the electrostatics of the DNA-CNT hybrid depends on tube diameter and electronic properties, enabling nanotube separation by anion exchange chromatography. Optical absorption and Raman spectroscopy show that early fractions are enriched in the smaller diameter and metallic tubes, whereas late fractions are enriched in the larger diameter and semiconducting tubes.},
